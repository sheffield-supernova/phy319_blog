This blog is designed to be a repository for questions, answers, comments and
queries that may arise over the course of the PHY319 project.  I will attempt to
post useful snippets, generally in code form, that should help overcome those
annoying obstacles that can be time consuming and get in the way of doing the
actual science.  As the project progresses new posts will be added that are
relevant to each stage.   If you have any questions or
difficulties, do send me an email and I will respond as soon as I can and I will
also write a post here (so that there is always an online resource that you can check
with at anytime).  If an issue comes up that I've not discussed or posted about
here, it's important that you let me know so that I can cover it!
